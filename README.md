# Predicting-Clustering-Banking-Subscriptions
In this project (uni assignment), I used a dataset containing bank customers’ data which was collected 
through phone calls. The data includes various variables about each customer and whether 
they Subscribed to a bank’s service or not. The dataset consist of around *38.000* records. The aim of this project is to try 4 different 
classification methods in order to predict whether a customer will subscribe or not, taking into 
consideration the data about them. <br/>
The classification methods I used are the following:</br>
1) **K-Nearest Neighbor**
2) **Random Forest Classification**
3) **Naïve Bayes Classifier**
4) **Support Vector Machines**<br/>
<br/>
To compare each method, the Accuracy metric will be used to evaluate the predictions, and the method with the highest accuracy will be chosen.<br/>
<br/>
In the end of the project, I also attempt to cluster the customers by taking into account specific variables 
about them. <br/>
<br/>
To cluster the customers, I will use the **Partitioning Around Medoids** method, I 
will also attempt to characterize each cluster by its demographics and average customer 
profile.
